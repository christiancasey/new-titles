      <h1>New Titles: {{ range_low }} - {{ range_high }}</h1>

      <p>The following books were acquired and accessioned by the <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/library/">ISAW Library</a> between {{ range_low }} and {{ range_high }}. Items are grouped by geographic region, and sorted by Library of Congress classification. This information is also available in a <a href=" {{ zotero }} ">Zotero library</a>.</p>
         
      <p>The ISAW Library compiles a single Zotero "library" for the entire year, with each
         month representing a separate Zotero "collection." The metadata tags are only linked
         or searchable at the "library" level, not at the "collection" level. For example,
         if you review acquisitions for December 2015 and select the tag for "Hittite," nothing
         may come up. However, if you move up the hierarchy from the collection "December 2015"
         to the "library" for 2015 and then click on "Hittite," you will find items tagged
         from previous months. Click here for information about Zotero. <a href="http://www.zotero.org">Click here for information about Zotero</a>.
